# Movie Database

This project was made as part of the TMDB code challenge. I initially made the very same app using React.js but wanted to see if I could recreate it using Vue.js as I had never worked in Vue before. Still very much learning when it comes to Vue but the point of this app was to just get started to see how it worked. The app makes use of the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started).

## Credits

Credits go to TMDB for supplying the API and to Harry who passed on the challenge information to me so I could practise.
